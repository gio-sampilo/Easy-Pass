# Easy-Pass
The intention of this project was to create an application that would enable users to generate random passwords. The JavaScript code will provide functionality to the HTML and CSS, and enable the user to operate without any issues. This modified code resolves the bugs within the original code, as well as inserting needed code. I learned how to create variables and arrays, and utilize functions to generate the random password upon click.
